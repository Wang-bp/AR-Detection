  This is a Python package for automated synoptic moisture transport detection, axis finding 
and tracking from gridded Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) data, for instance Reanalysis datasets, 
or model simulations. 
  You can follow the steps below:
  1. calculate IVT and IVT-anomaly by using compute_ivt.py and compute_ivt-anomaly.py.
  2. detect synoptic moisture transport by using detect_ARs.py.
  3. trace synoptic moisture transport by using trace_ARs.py.
